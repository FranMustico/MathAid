# MathStudentHelp
This program allows students improve their skills in math, allowing them to practice 5 main mathematics topics (arithmetics, algebra, trigonometry, geometry &amp; functions). More details available at the read me file. 

Since this is a work in progress, it is necesarry for the user to download both files available in the folder above. The csv contains the mathematical questions that the program will utilize, the questions that the student will answer. These questions can be modified to the programmer's or the teacher's liking, since the program is made to read any type of text output and text input that is introduced into the csv. 

for a smoother configuration, I recommend that both files (MAIN.py & df_preguntas.csv) are saved in the same folder, for easier access.
